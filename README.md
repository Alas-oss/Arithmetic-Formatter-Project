# Arithmetic-Formatter-Project
The Arithmetic Arranger is a Python function that formats basic arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) into a vertically aligned format for display. It can optionally compute and display the results of the problems. This tool is particularly useful for educational purposes, such as teaching or practicing arithmetic in a clean and organized format.
## Features
- Format up to five arithmetic problems vertically.
- Supports addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators.
- Validates input for correctness:
-- Ensures operators are valid (+ or -).
-- Ensures operands are numerical and contain no more than four digits.
- Displays answer if enabled
